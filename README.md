- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @augustlogstrup
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about making a website. my biggest issue is PSP and how to connet it with my website. 
so i have made a front with a header and footer and ekstra stuff. and some a href to other sites. ive made a home buttom, basket, katalog and profile/login
and now i just need to make a basket and a working login, i would be nice if there could be some PSP SQL and Python
